# Finswift


FinSwift is a comprehensive web application developed using the Streamlit framework in Python, designed for stock market analysis and forecasting. This application offers three main utilities:

1. Stock Performance Comparison: Users can select multiple stocks from a list and visualize their relative returns, closing prices, and trading volumes over a specified date range. The application supports line charts, area charts, and bar charts for effective data visualization.

2. Real-Time Stock Price: This utility allows users to select a company and retrieve its real-time stock price data. Users can choose to visualize the data using candlestick charts or line charts, providing insights into price movements and market trends.

3. Stock Price Prediction: Leveraging the powerful Prophet forecasting library, users can select a company and a prediction time horizon (1 to 4 years). The application trains a predictive model on historical data and generates forecasts, including visualizations of forecast data, forecast plots, and forecast components.

FinSwift aims to empower users with comprehensive tools for stock market analysis and forecasting, enabling informed investment decisions through intuitive data visualization and predictive modeling techniques. Developed by a team of data enthusiasts, this application showcases the power of Python and Streamlit in building interactive and insightful web applications for the finance domain.
